<!--HOW TO COMPLETE THIS FORM:-->

<!--
1. Checkboxes in this document appear as follows: 

- [ ] This is a checkbox 

To check a checkbox, replace [ ] by [x], as follows: 

- [x] This is a checked checkbox 

Note that current versions of RStudio for Mac (this will change with RStudio versions 1.3 and higher) will not create a formatted checkbox but will leave the original characters, i.e., literally "[ ]" or "[x]". It's fine to submit a PDF in this form.
 
2. For text answers, simply type the relevant text in the areas indicated. A blank line starts a new paragraph. 
 
3. Comments (like these instructions) provide additional instructions throughout the form. There is no need to remove them; they will not appear in the compiled document. 

4. If you are comfortable with Markdown syntax, you may choose to include any Markdown-compliant formatting in the form. For example, you may wish to include R code chunks and compile this document in R Markdown.

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the data
-->
The Physionet 2012 Challenge dataset is an EHR dataset that contains 12,000 ICU patients with measurements of 37 variables across 48 time points, with one hour between each consecutive time point. Pre-processing of the data was done using the code in [this repository](https://github.com/alistairewj/challenge2012), which uses prior domain knowledge to compress the repeated measurements into one observation per patient. The patients are divided into training, validation, and test sets of equal sizes, and an entry is missing if, for a patient, the corresponding feature was not measured at any time point.

## Availability


- [x] Data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Data **cannot be made** publicly available.

If the data are publicly available, see the *Publicly available data* section. Otherwise, see the *Non-publicly available data* section, below.

### Publicly available data

- [x] Data are available online at:
Various locations. See the supplementary materials of the NIMIWAE manuscript (NIMIWAE_Appendix.pdf) for details on these datasets. Missingness is simulated on top of the UCI datasets, while missingness is inherent in the Physionet dataset. The missingness-simulated datasets can be reproduced by using the code in the reproducibility repository (using the default seed as provided), and these datasets can also be provided by request. These links are copied below for your convenience.

# Part 2: Code

## Abstract

<!--
Provide a short (< 100 words), high-level description of the code. If necessary, more details can be provided in files that accompany the code.
-->
This code reproduces training of models and summarization of results in the paper "Handling Non-ignorably Missing Features in Electronic Health Records Data Using Importance-Weighted Autoencoders." We show superiority of NIMIWAE in imputation of simulated missing values, and perform comparative analyses on the Physionet 2012 Challenge EHR Dataset, showing improvements in imputed missing entries.

# Part 3: Reproducibility workflow

<!--
The materials provided should provide a straightforward way for reviewers and readers to reproduce analyses with as few steps as possible. 
-->

## Scope

The provided workflow reproduces:

- [x] Any numbers provided in text in the paper
- [x] All tables and figures in the paper
- [ ] Selected tables and figures in the paper, as explained and justified below:

## Workflow


### Format(s)

<!--
Check all that apply
-->
- [ ] Single master code file 
- [ ] Wrapper (shell) script(s)
- [ ] Self-contained R Markdown file, Jupyter notebook, or other literate programming approach
- [ ] Text file (e.g., a readme-style file) that documents workflow
- [ ] Makefile
- [x] Other (more detail in *Instructions* below)

### Instructions

<!--
Describe how to use the materials provided to reproduce analyses in the manuscript. Additional details can be provided in file(s) accompanying the reproducibility materials.
-->
Run `runComparisons.R` script to train all models (time-consuming). Then, run `SummarizeResults.R` script to reproduce Figures 2 and 3, and the results in Table 2.

### Expected run-time

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard desktop machine:

- [ ] < 1 minute
- [ ] 1-10 minutes
- [ ] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [x] > 8 hours
- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described here

Training the deep learning architectures can be very time-consuming, and it may be recommended to run on a computing cluster with access to a GPU with a large memory (at least 16GB recommended). Summarizing the results should not take any longer than 10 minutes.

### Additional information (optional)

<!--
OPTIONAL: Additional documentation provided (e.g., R package vignettes, demos or other examples) that show how to use the provided code/software in other settings.
-->

The blinded reproducibility repository can be found [here](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cc924aeb-9dcb-47f7-a1bb-372d87667deb/), and it can also be found attached in the original submission for convenience.
